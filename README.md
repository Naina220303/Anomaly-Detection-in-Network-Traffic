ANOMALY DETECTION IN NETWORK TRAFFIC

Anomaly detection in network traffic involves identifying unusual patterns or behaviors that deviate from normal network activity. 
Unsupervised learning techniques like isolation forests and autoencoders can be used to detect anomalies without the need for labeled data. 
Isolation forests leverage decision trees to isolate anomalies, while autoencoders reconstruct input data to identify deviations. 
By analyzing network traffic data and detecting anomalies, organizations can enhance cybersecurity defenses and proactively respond to potential threats.
